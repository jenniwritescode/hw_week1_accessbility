# Homework Week 1 - Accessibility

## Requirements - Refactor existing code using the following user story and acceptance criteria.

### User Story

```

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

```

- added reset.css stylesheet- 
added alt text to images
