# Homework Week 1 - Accessibility

## Requirements - Refactor existing code using the following user story and acceptance criteria.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## I made the following updates to the existing code:

- added alt text to images
- fixed anchor links on nav bar
- added reset.css stylesheet
- consolidated classes and ids in style.css
- *to do: comment code for readability*
